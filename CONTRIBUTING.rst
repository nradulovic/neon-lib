We'd love to accept your sample apps and patches! 

Contributing a Patch

1. Create your change to the repo in question.
   * Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
   * Ensure that your code is clear and comprehensible.
2. Submit a pull request.
3. The repo owner will review your request. If it is approved, the change will
   be merged. If it needs additional work, the repo owner will respond with
   useful comments.
